# xAPI Profile Server
The profile server is based on the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack. All source files are included in the zip. 

### Project Structure
Root Project folder/  
|  _base project files - Readme, server app, dependencies list.._  
| -- client/ - React app, React dependencies list, UI components, HTML assets, etc  
| -- server/ - Express app, server routes, profile db models

## Dependencies
Development environment dependencies to run the profile server. Download and install.

- node (v. 12.16.2): https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- yarn (v.1.21.1): https://yarnpkg.com/
- mongo (v. 4.0.1): https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community

A full list of library dependencies can be found in: 
- package.json
- client/package.json

## Client
A React Single Page App created using `yarn create react-app client`. Follow the [Deliverable History](https://github.com/adlnet/profile-server/wiki/Deliverable-History) for development and builds. You will need to `$client: yarn` to install node_modules.

## Server
Express server configured to serve a React SPA. It also has the API designed for the Profile server. It uses MongoDB as its database. You will need to `$: yarn` to install server node_modules.

## Dev Setup
1. In a terminal, start the mongodb server `mongod`
1. Extract the project
1. In a new terminal navigate inside the project folder and enter the command `$: yarn` to install node modules
1. Verify there is an `.env` file at the root of the project. If not, check the included `.env.example` file that is included in the root directory [here](../.env.example).
1. Type `$: yarn start` to start the profile server
1. Open another terminal and navigate to `<project_folder>/client`
1. Type `yarn` to install the profile client modules
1. Then type `$: yarn start` to start the client app.
    1. The initial start of the client development server takes significant time to start-up. This is due to dependency mapping it needs to run to figure out where required files exist in the project. Subsequent starts of the development server are much faster.

## Test
Server-side unit tests are located at `/test`. They can be run by using the command `$: yarn test` at the command line. Results will be printed in the terminal.

> NOTE: There are parallel tests in /server/test/routes/publicAPI/profile/metadata.test.js that will occasionally fail when running the full test suite. You can individually run those metadata tests by running the command `$: yarn test metadata`. 

The profileValidator module has tests that use the profiles found in ADL's `https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-authored-profiles` project. Download or clone the project into the `/server/profileValidator` folder before running these tests.

## Run
A browser tab should open and show the index page of the app after executing the `$client: yarn start` command in the client folder. _If it didn't automatically open, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000_

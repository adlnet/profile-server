                The Profile Server has a built in seach feature when adding new
                profiles. Always search on exisiting vocabulary concepts,
                profiles, and statementtemplates before defining your own.

          Most profile questions can vbe answered by browsing the  {" "}

          <a href="https://adlnet.gov/guides/xapi-profile-server/" target>
            Profile Server Info Page.
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>Q: Can I delete concepts I create in the Profile Server?
       <br></br>
        A: Not really.  xAPI Concepts, Statement Templates, Patterns, and even Profiles can be deprecated, such that references don't break if these objects are removed
          If one of those objects is deprecated AND not referenced, it will be deleted by ADL Staff.
        </p>  
        <p>Q: The generated IRIs all begin with the xAPI Profile Server web address, are we done using w3ids for persistent URLs?
        <br></br>
        A: Definitely not!  The best practice is to coin your own IRI that begins with https://w3id.org/xapi/ and is formatted appropriately to the concept, etc. type.</p>
        <p>
        Q: My verb is taken already.  What do I do?
        <br></br>
        A: First, for any concept, determine if the underlying meaning is the same and if it is, use that concept (e.g. verb) by referencing it.  If it isn't, you can still
          use any "display" you want as two different profiles can use the same "name" of the verb, just not the same identifier.
        </p>
        <p>Q: Do I need a working group to create a profile?
        <br></br>
        A: No.  While this site will "make you" create a Working Group, the URL is more important.  If it doesn't link to a group that supports the profile, then a link to
          a version of that profile document (narrative or technical) is completely acceptable.
        </p>
        <p>Q: Should I be creating Statement Templates in my profile?  I do want anyone to be able to use my concepts.
        <br></br>
        A: Absolutely.  Statement templates should be about as numerous as verbs in an xAPI Profile.  They provide the "if/then" rules for data validation. The only time
          you have to worry about imposing requirements on others is if they use your profile, which is exactly what you want.  Concepts developed in one profile can be used in
          any other profile.
        </p>
        <p>Q: Help!  I cannot reference any of the Concepts, Statement Templates, or Patterns I am creating in my profile.
        <br></br>
        A: This is a known bug.  Objects aren't referenceable until the profile is published, which can make it very difficult to complete accurately.  The best workaround
          is to be careful with IRIs, publish, and then make edits/additions iteratively.

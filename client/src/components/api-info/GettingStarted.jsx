            <Description>
                The xAPI Profile Server has an API for performing basic operations on the server, such as importing,
                updating and validating profiles. It also provides a SPARQL endpoint to make more in-depth queries to the
                server. Finally the API provides a mechanism via webhooks to listen to events about a specific profile.
            </Description>
            <Description>
                There are two types of endpoints: protected and public routes. Public routes are accessible without the need to
                authenticate. These include getting published profiles, getting a single published profile, and validating a
                JSON-LD profile document. Other endpoints are protected from unauthenticated access, such as publishing a profile
                or editing a draft.

            <Description>
                To begin sending HTTP requests to the protected routes of the API, one first needs to create an API key. API keys
                are owned by, and associated to a working group. More than one API key can be created, and each key can be scoped to
                read, write, or both. The key contains a UUID which is the value for the HTTP Header property
                (<CodeSpan>x-api-key</CodeSpan>). Below are the steps to get set up:
                <Notice>
                    Creating and viewing access keys is only available to working group admins. Contact your working group admin
                    if you need a key.
                </Notice>

                    <li>Join a working group or select the working group under which you want to create the key</li>

                    <li>Fill in the name, choose read and write permissions, keep the status 'Enabled'</li>
                    <li>Click the Create API Key button</li>
                    <li>The UUID in the Key column of the table is the value used in the HTTP Header (x-xapi-key)</li>
